00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.147
[VOICE OVER] Another area to observe 
caution is when using the internet, 

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:05.523
especially when transferring credit 
card data. 

00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:12.295
Make sure when you enter data on a webpage 
that it starts with “https” rather than “http”. 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.614
This means you are using encryption to protect 
sensitive information. 

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.264
The “s” stands for secure. 

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:19.874
The browser encrypts the data before sending it. 

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:24.532
After it reaches its destination it is decrypted, 
or returned, to its original state.

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.791
Also, be cautious when using email. 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.937
For example, emails typically travel insecurely 
through the internet and can be intercepted. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.200
Never send sensitive cardholder information 
using open, unencrypted email. 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.564
Keep in mind, messages stay on your computer 
until deleted. 

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:43.750
Even after you delete them, copies often 
remain somewhere within the organization’s network. 

00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:48.670
Software exists that can scan messages and 
different types of documents, looking for 

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:50.220
16-digit number sequences. 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.624
So even if you can’t find that email, 
a hacker easily can. 

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:57.737
Since we are on the topic of email, there 
are some important best practices you should 

00:00:57.738 --> 00:00:59.694
take any time you receive a message. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.551
Make sure you stop, look, and think when 
receiving an email and:

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:09.207
● Don’t rush to open unexpected attachments; 
if something seems suspicious, verify it’s 

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:11.144
legitimate before you open it. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.547
● Hover over links; move your mouse over the 
link to see where it would actually take you. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.119
● Analyze email addresses; make sure the “Reply-To” 
address is the same as the “From” line address.
