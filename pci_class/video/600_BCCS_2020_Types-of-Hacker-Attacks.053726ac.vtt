00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.181
[VOICE OVER] Let’s explore four of 
the more common types of attacks 

00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:04.650
that cybercriminals like to use.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.935
One of the most common and deadliest 
methods of attack, as far as a user is 

00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:11.743
concerned, is a phishing attack.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:15.624
In this type of attack, a hacker sends an 
email that appears to be legitimate with 

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:19.086
the goal of gaining personal information or 
influencing you to do something. 

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:23.243
Often, they attempt to alarm you, making you 
believe that there is a serious situation you 

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:24.714
need to take care of right away.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.160
Once you take the action they want, the hacker 
gains entry into your organization’s network and 

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.900
from there can access all the card information.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.981
A second type of attack uses ransomware, which 
is a type of malware that scrambles the data 

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:39.995
in computer files and makes them unreadable. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.172
It can spread to all the devices and files across 
a network and denies access until a ransom is paid. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.664
Ransomware is often installed on systems by 
opening attachments or links that are contained 

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:51.218
in malicious email messages. 

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:55.343
It can also be installed by interacting with 
malicious pop-up windows in your internet 

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:59.189
browser or connecting unknown flash drives or 
other devices to your system.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.072
A third way hackers like to target you is 
through the free Wi-Fi that is commonly 

00:01:05.073 --> 00:01:09.911
found and easily accessible in many locations, 
such as airports, libraries, and coffee shops.

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:15.203
Public Wi-Fi is dangerous because it is typically 
unsecured, and hackers are able to easily steal 

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:17.771
your data as it travels over the 
establishment's connection.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.518
This means that anyone within range can see 
everything you’re doing online if they have 

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:23.559
the right software. 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.895
This includes the websites you visit, texts 
and emails you send out, and your username and 

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.823
password for anything you access.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.270
The fourth type of attack goes after the 
information on the card itself. 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.638
The bad guys use a physical device called a 
skimmer to steal credit card data. 

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:44.691
It could occur at an ATM, a gas station fuel pump, 
or even your local supermarket or restaurant. 

00:01:44.982 --> 00:01:49.038 
When a credit card is swiped through a skimmer, 
the device captures and stores the information 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.570
from the magnetic stripe. 

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:54.522
This includes the card number, expiration date, 
and the cardholder's full name. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.000
Bad guys can then use this information to create 
fraudulent credit cards.
