00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.100
[VOICE OVER] As we have discovered, these 
attacks can happen in a variety of ways. 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.246
They could even be done without your knowing! 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.287
What then can be done to stop the hackers 
from being successful?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.100
Your IT department is one line of defense. 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.344
They work to keep the organization’s computer 
systems secure from hackers by using special 

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:20.167
security rules to keep card information 
separate from regular organization data, 

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:24.994
limiting access to only a few individuals, and 
securing card data with encryption, which is 

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:28.049
the process of scrambling the information to 
make it unreadable. 

00:00:28.353 --> 00:00:33.064
To view the data, someone needs the correct 
security code (or key) to unscramble or decrypt it.

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:37.872
However, your IT team cannot control everything 
that puts data at risk. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.150
You are an equally important line of defense. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.415
It only takes one mistake to get hacked and then 
all of the credit card data is at risk.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:48.486
Protecting yourself and keeping your 
organization’s information secure starts 

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:50.137
with being aware of your surroundings.

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:54.851
● Alert security if you notice oddities like 
doors being left open or things not being 

00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:56.457
locked up when they should be.

00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:01.140
● Notify IT and security if you see any 
evidence of tampering or any unusual devices 

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:02.700
connected to systems you use.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.911
● Report to IT any strange system messages and 
weird behavior on your device. 

00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:10.620
Be as specific as you can with exactly what you 
were doing when it happened, 

00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:11.630
and

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:13.279
● Think before sharing information.  

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.216
You never know who might be around
listening to your conversations. 

00:01:16.217 --> 00:01:19.669
Also, anything you put on the internet, 
including emails and social media, 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.308
stays available forever.

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:27.555
Remember, what you do (and don’t do) can make 
or break any viable security procedures.
