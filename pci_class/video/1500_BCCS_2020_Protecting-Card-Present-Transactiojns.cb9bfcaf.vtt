00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.545
[VOICE OVER] Let’s explore three newer 
technologies that can help keep credit card 

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:08.060
information safe in card present situations, 
which is when the cardholder and payment card 

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:09.000
are both present.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.700
“Chip” cards have replaced the magnetic stripe cards. 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.968
The chip embedded in the card generates a unique code 
that is used for each transaction, making fraud almost 

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:21.200
impossible when inserted into a terminal.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.185
Contactless transactions use a tiny computer chip and a 
radio wave to transmit account information from the card 

00:00:27.186 --> 00:00:28.155
to a terminal. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
You can use these by simply putting the card next 
to the terminal. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.500
While convenient, these cards can be skimmed without ever 
leaving your pocket.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.750
Mobile device-based “wallets”, such as Apple Pay and 
Google Wallet, are perhaps the most popular new 

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:43.261
technology for credit cards. 

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:48.792
Found even on smart watches, security is maintained 
by using a “token”, or representation of the card, 

00:00:48.793 --> 00:00:52.500
rather than storing or sending a credit card number 
during a transaction.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.319
Note, these technologies do not improve the security 
of card not present transactions, which are done 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.300
through the Internet, over the phone, or where the 
card number is manually typed into the system.
