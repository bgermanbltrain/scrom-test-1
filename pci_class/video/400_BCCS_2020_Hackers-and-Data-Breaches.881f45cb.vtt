00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.030
[VOICE OVER] So, who is trying to get 
this information?

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.965
Organizations are under constant attack 
by cybercriminals, also known as hackers. 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.180
Either by tricking people or using software, 
their goal is to illegally gain access or 

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:13.927
control of computer systems. 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.643
If their attacks are successful, the result 
is a data breach, which is the intentional 

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:21.900
or unintentional release of secure information 
to an unsecured environment.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.918
Sometimes they do this using social engineering, 
which is the art of manipulating, influencing, 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.754
or deceiving you into taking some action that 
isn’t in your own best interest or the best 

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:33.117
interest of your organization. 

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:38.394
Often, they also use malware, which is short 
for “malicious software,” an umbrella term 

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:42.517
for all the software out there that is being 
used by cybercriminals to spy on you and 

00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:43.633
steal your information.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:47.290
These hackers are after your organization’s 
crown jewels. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.700
In this case, they are after all the credit 
card data in your system. 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.805
For instance, on Nov. 30, 2018, Marriott and 
its Starwood Hotel brand reported a data breach

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.685
of staggering proportions, believed to have 
included compromised information for almost 

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:05.300
500 million customers. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.580
Shockingly, the breach likely began over 4 years 
earlier in July 2014 and included their customer’s 

00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:15.767
payment information, names, mailing addresses, 
phone numbers, email addresses, and passport numbers.

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:21.083
What most people don't know, and can be even more 
shocking, is that for every big breach that makes 

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:26.000
the headlines, dozens of smaller data breaches occur 
in less well-known companies.

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:30.495
The cost of a breach goes well beyond the actual losses. 

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:33.295
Fines may be imposed, cards have to be replaced, and 

00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:38.572
investigations by outside parties must be done—all of which 
are paid for by the company that was breached. 

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:41.400
While that is bad enough, it gets worse! 

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:46.018
There are also indirect costs that would impact 
future sales, such as: 

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:50.070
disruption to the business, time spent notifying victims 
and investigating the incident, 

00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:55.322
providing customers with credit reporting services or 
identity theft protection, and, most importantly, 

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.569
loss of goodwill and customer loyalty.

00:01:57.843 --> 00:02:02.457
That’s why it is in the best interest of your entire 
organization for you to understand your role in 

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:04.333
keeping credit card information secure.
