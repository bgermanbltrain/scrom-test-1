00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.147
[VOICE OVER] The main types of cards are 
Visa, Mastercard, American Express, 

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:04.956
and Discover. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.874
Beyond credit cards, there are numerous 
card types that can be used in place of money. 

00:00:09.103 --> 00:00:10.935
Debit cards are the most known example. 

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:16.399
Some lesser-known examples include gift cards, 
prepaid cards, international cards, store cards, 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.955
and electronic benefit cards. 

00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:22.670
Please note: As you progress through the module, 
anytime you see a reference to credit cards, 

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:26.000
know that the information applies to any of 
these payment card types.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.991
Even though there are many types of cards, they 
all follow the same security rules. 

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:36.679
These rules are defined by the Payment Card 
Industry or (PCI) Security Standards Council. 

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:40.900
This group is responsible for creating and 
updating the many policies and rules that 

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:42.571
govern the credit card industry. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.321
The goal is to enhance global payment account 
data security worldwide. 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.337
If your organization handles any of these card types, 
then the payment card security rules will apply to you. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.274
So what card information is important to protect? 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.455
The most sensitive credit card information,
and thus the most valuable to the bad guys,

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:00.331
is called “cardholder data”. 

00:01:00.574 --> 00:01:01.450
This includes:

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.551
● The 16-digit “PAN,” or primary account number. 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.636
You typically call this your card number.

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:09.329
● The three- or four-digit security code. 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.671
You have likely heard this code referred 
to as the CVV – card verification value,

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:15.917
 or CVC – card verification code. 

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:20.663
For Visa, Mastercard, and Discover, it is the 
three-digit code found on the back of the card. 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.100
For American Express, it is the four-digit code on 
the front of the card.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.943
AND

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:31.891
● The “PIN,” or personal identification number. 
This is a secret numerical code known only by 

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.638
the user and the security system. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.334
It is required by some cards before they can be used.
