phone that the credit card records of 

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:07.450
500 million individuals were found for sale 
on a hacker website. 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.650
What would your first reaction be? Indifference?

Concern? Dread?

if you had been the one responsible for clicking

access to all of that information.
