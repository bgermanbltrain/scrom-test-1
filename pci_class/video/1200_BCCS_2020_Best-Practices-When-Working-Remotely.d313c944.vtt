00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.210
[VOICE OVER] Anytime you are working 
remotely, you are at an increased 

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:04.475
risk of being hacked. 

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:08.137
The devices are often less secure and 
the bad guys can be lurking around every 

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:09.841
corner trying to see what you are doing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
You can protect against this and keep card 
information secure by:

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.500
● Regularly updating your software, 
particularly any security updates

00:00:19.217 --> 00:00:21.206
● Running up-to-date antivirus software

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.600
● Scanning all media and attachments introduced 
to your system

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:32.199
● Using a firewall, which is a device or software 
product that is designed to block unauthorized 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.909
access while permitting authorized communications

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.043
● Not visiting questionable web sites

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.000
● Only using that system for work

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:44.800
● Always locking the device when not in use, and

00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:49.280
● Staying aware of your surroundings and not 
working with sensitive information if 

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.700
something seems suspicious.   

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:55.231
Additionally, when working remotely for your 
organization, only connect to the internet 

00:00:55.232 --> 00:00:58.200
while using a virtual private network (VPN).

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.591
This technology creates a safe internet connection 

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:02.848
that shields your online activity from the bad guys. 

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.100
Your IT team can set this up for you. 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.421
Most importantly, never send full cardholder
numbers over these public networks

00:01:09.422 --> 00:01:12.400
without using a VPN along with encryption.
