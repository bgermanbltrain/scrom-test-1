00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.097
[VOICE OVER] Mobile devices have their 
own set of best practices when it comes 

00:00:03.098 --> 00:00:04.805
to protecting credit card data. 

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:09.225
Always be aware of how vulnerable these 
devices are because of how easily they 

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:10.523
can be lost or stolen. 

00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:15.503
Make sure you have some type of passcode or 
biometric lock in place to secure the device.

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:20.730
Never use a mobile device to text full cardholder 
information or to take or send a picture to 

00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.500
“save” credit card information for processing later. 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.003
It might seem like a convenient thing to do; however, 
this is not secure as messages and photos going 

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:30.600
through text can be hacked.

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:36.903
If you take credit cards for your organization on 
mobile devices, ideally, you should do so on a 

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.497
dedicated phone or tablet that has no other 
applications on it. 

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:45.063
Since it is not always possible to do that or 
take credit card information in a fully secured 

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:50.081
environment, make sure you use a validated card 
reader that encrypts the data and can process the 

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.222
latest security features built into credit cards.

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:57.000
Let’s take a moment and complete an exercise 
covering the best practices we have been reviewing.
