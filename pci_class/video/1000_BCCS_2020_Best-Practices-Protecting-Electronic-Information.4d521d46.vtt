00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.898
[VOICE OVER] Let’s explore four best 
practices you should be following

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.721
when working with sensitive credit 
card information electronically. 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:09.406
First, make sure you are securing access 
to the system. 

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:10.834
Think of your front door. 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.500
How secure would the contents inside your 
home be if you didn’t have a lock on the door? 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.713
Securing access starts with using strong passwords. 

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.980
In general, here are some vital recommendations 
about passwords:

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.900
● Never reuse passwords

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.709
● Don’t be predictable, get creative

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:29.513
● Don’t create derivatives, like using the same 
word but just changing the number on the end 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.075
● The longer the password, the harder it is to crack 

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:37.433
● Whenever possible use a passphrase, which is 
a collection of words and spaces that are familiar to you, 

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:39.073
of at least 25-characters. 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.570
A passphrase is easier for you to remember but much more 
secure against the software used to crack passwords. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.441
An example could be, “My high school mascot says hoot hoot”

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.973
A second best practice is to secure valuable cardholder 
information by means of encryption. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.177
When you aren’t actively using that information on your 
system, make sure it’s saved in an encrypted format.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:03.700
A third best practice involves the proper storage of 
cardholder data on your computer. 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.339
Never save full 16-digit card numbers on your system, 
although truncated card data 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.493
(only the last four digits of a card number) 
is okay to store. 

00:01:11.777 --> 00:01:17.438
Additionally, don’t ever store the three-digit or 
four-digit security codes or any security PINs. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.067
This includes using any spreadsheet, word processing, 
presentation, database, or accounting programs 

00:01:23.068 --> 00:01:24.564
to store credit card data. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.821
Even if the files from any of those programs are 
named in a way to avoid detection and password-protected, 

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:34.649
the cardholder data can still be easily found and stolen 
by experienced hackers.

00:01:34.912 --> 00:01:40.306
The fourth best practice is to use caution when handling 
or storing cardholder data on removable devices, 

00:01:40.307 --> 00:01:42.532
like thumb drives or external hard drives. 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.446
A common misconception is that putting full cardholder 
data on such a device is safe. 

00:01:47.447 --> 00:01:50.664
It’s not! They can be easily misplaced or stolen. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.200
If the data is not encrypted, it is open to whoever 
finds or gets their hands on it.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.468
Additionally, any information stored on removable 
devices becomes visible to the entire network 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.200
when connected to your computer. 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.825
If a hacker has already gotten into your 
organization’s network, they will be able 

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:07.400
to retrieve all of that information. 

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:11.151
Therefore, it’s best to avoid removable 
media whenever possible.
