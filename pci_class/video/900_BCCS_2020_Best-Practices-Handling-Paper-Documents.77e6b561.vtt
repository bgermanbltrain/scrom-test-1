00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.255
[VOICE OVER] Let’s review some simple 
best practices you can do to help 

00:00:03.256 --> 00:00:08.840
keep your organization’s information 
secure, starting with paper documents.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.869
Although we sometimes assume everything 
is electronic today, there are numerous 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.034
cases where credit card information is 
contained on paper documents. 

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:19.077
You might not think that these need 
to be secured, but they do. 

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:22.569
Here are some things you can do when 
handling paper documents to keep the 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.600
information safe:

00:00:24.077 --> 00:00:27.006
● Lock up paper documents containing 
credit card information when they’re not 

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.032
in use and keep a log of what data 
is kept and where.

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:32.914
● Properly destroy card data when it is 
no longer needed. 

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:36.932
● Use a carrier that provides tracking 
information if sending papers containing 

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.411
sensitive cardholder information.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.872
● As a rule, never store card data for 
longer than six months unless there is 

00:00:42.873 --> 00:00:45.000
a legal reason to do so.
